Great way to learn working of Sorting Algorithms.
Here I have added 5 sorting algorithms.

1. Bubble Sort
   This Algorithm repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order or previous element is larger than the current element.So in one pass of this algorithm the largest element from the array reaches the end of the array like a bubble reaches the surface.Hence this Algorithm is termed as Bubble Sort Algorithm.Algorithm works with a worst case Time Complexity of O(N^2)
